  <p>Stress is your body's way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it's real or imagined—the body's defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction or the "stress response." The stress response is the body's way of protecting you.It flushes the body with hormones to prepare systems to evade or confront danger. </p>
